ShapeKitDemo
============

Demo app for [ShapeKit](https://github.com/andreacremaschi/ShapeKit) - GEOS wrapper

Create ShapeKit geometries and display them on a MapKit map.
Since this project uses [CocoaPods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods) to include ShapeKit, you are suppose to install CocoaPods first (if you haven't already).
Then open Terminal, go to the ShapeKitDemo folder, type `pod install` and enjoy!
